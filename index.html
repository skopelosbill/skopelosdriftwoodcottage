            <p>Driftwood Cottage was built over 100 years ago and it has retained its Greek charm.  The location in the heart of town is wonderful,  within minutes of walking  to everything.  There are no stairs from the port to the cottage, making it family friendly. Although so centrally located , it is in a car free street, and it is in a very quiet area. It sleeps 5 people in 3 air-contitioned bedrooms with 2 bathrooms and wifi.  It also offers a roof terrace, with sea views, which has a fully equipped kitchen including dishwaser and wasing machine and a barbecue with an area to relax and also dine in.</p>

            <p class="comment">We had a wonderful time at Jan's place.  Situated at a 5 minutes walk (without steps) from the port, next to nice restaurants and bars but in a very quiet street, Jan's cottage is the ideal place for any type of traveller!  The cottage was spotlessely clean, really nicely decorated and had all the amenities described.  The terrace on the top floor is just amazing and really relaxing.  As for Jan, there are no words to describe how accomodating and helpful she is! Always there to answer questions and give amazing tips!  Thank you for every thing! </p>

            <p class="comment">The accomodation exceeded our expectations.  It's an authentic house in the center of Skopelos, literally the harbor, pubs, bars, and shops.  A three-story house has absolutely everything you need.  Equipped kitchen, three air-conditioned bedrooms, two bathrooms and toilet, washing machine, beautiful patio with barbecue.  Host Jan is very active and helpful.  She gave us her own car for a day and lots of helpful advice.  I definitely recommend.</p>

            <p class="comment">We had a very nice time!  The house is mega beautiful and furnished with a lot of love.  The roof terrace is a dream, great view and even a grill.  There are 2 bathrooms and 2 toilets, which of course is also very great!  Jan was ALWAYS reachable and had so many good tips for us that we didn't have to take care of anything.  She even lent us her car for free for a day.  Welcome - its wine, bread, olives and cheese!!  The house is super suitable for families and also for friends, because it is on 3 levels, it is rather not suitable for people who are stairs. We will definitely be back.</p>
